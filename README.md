# Calculus-Notes
The .pdfs in this repository are chapter notes for AP Calculus BC. Posted alongside them in the folder 'Code' are the corresponding .tex files which were used to compile them.

As new, updated iterations of the lecture notes are made, they will be posted in this repository. I will try my best to keep these notes up-to-date and publish them as soon as I've written and reviewed them.

When looking for the latest version of notes, **always select the .pdf with the greatest last number.**

Downloading the .pdf is recomended, but not necessary. The .pdf has ease-of-use features like hyperlinks that are unavailable in the Github preview.
